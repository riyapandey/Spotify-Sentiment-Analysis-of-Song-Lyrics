Bad times are comin' and I reap what I don't sow
Hey hey

Hey hey
It's been a long old trouble long old troublesome road
And I'm looking for somebody come and help me carry this load

I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Hey hey
Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need
Well I don't know if I'm walking on solid ground
Cause everything around me is falling down
And all I want - is for someone - to help me

I had a job but the boss man let me go
He said
I'm sorry but I won't be needing your help no more
I said
Please mister boss man I need this job more than you know
But he gave me my last paycheck and he sent me on out the door

Well I need a dollar dollar, a dollar is what I need

Cause everything around me is crumbling down
And all I want is for someone to help me

What in the world am I gonna to do tomorrow
Is there someone whose dollar that I can borrow
Who can help me take away my sorrow
Maybe its inside the bottle
Maybe its inside the bottle
I had some good old buddy his names is whiskey and wine
Hey hey
And for my good old buddy I spent my last dime
Hey hey
My wine is good to me it helps me pass the time
And my good old buddy whiskey keeps me warmer than the sunshine
Hey Hey
Your mom of mayhem just a child has got his own
Hey Hey
If god has plans for me I hope it ain't, written in stone
Hey Hey
Because I've been working working myself down to the bone
And I swear on grandpas grave I'll be paid when I come home

Airplanes (feat. Hayley Williams of Paramore),B.o.B, Rap/Hip-Hop,2010,87,66,-4,4,38,11,12,80,"Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, yeah I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partying and smashing and crashing
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time when you fade to the blackness
And when you're staring at the phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that then I'll switch my flight and
I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

Yeah yeah somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah back when I was trying to get a tip at subway
And back then I was rapping for the hell of it
But nowadays we rapping to stay relevant
I'm guessing if can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe oh maybe I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain't nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before when I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for the Decatur what's up Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this shit
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hoping we can make some wishes outta airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now

I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shootin' stars
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
A wish a wish right now"

I got the magic in me

Everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants a blast of

Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ah ooh
I got the magic in me!

These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you every line
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front, and stand right here and don't be shy
I'll have you time-travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryna inherit the skill so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes, and
I see Mindfreak like, ""What's up man, what's happenin'?""
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, no Ghost or Poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man, I float on Cloud 9

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes it turns to gold)

Ah ooh
I got the magic in me!

We'll take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road, so I call my mama when I got time
I hit the stage, go insane, then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow
See I deceive you with my intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave you with amnesia
I break all the rules like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you saying, it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

I got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold (Yes it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I've got the magic in me (I got the magic, baby)

Somewhere far away
I want you back
I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have
You're all I have

At night when the stars
Light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Tryin' to get to you
In hopes you're on
The other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
Who sits alone
Talking to the moon

Oh

I'm feeling like I'm famous
The talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know

'Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back
Yeah they're talking back

At night when the stars
Light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Tryin' to get to you
In hopes you're on
The other side
Talking to me too
Or am I a fool
Who sits alone
Talking to the moon

(Ah, ah, ah)

Do you ever hear me calling?
(Ah) oh oh oh
(Ah) oh oh oh

I'm talking to the moon

Just the Way You Are,Bruno Mars, Pop,2010,84,64,-5,6,42,1,4,86,"Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin' 
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me ""Do I look okay?""
I say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change 'cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah

Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful, and I tell her everyday

Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say

When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are

You ain't nothin' but a vulture
Always hopin' for the worst
Waiting for me to f*ck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I know you mad but so what?
I wish you best of luck
And now I'm 'bout to throw them deuces up

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Uh, use to be valentines
Together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind
F*ck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some

'Cause when it's all said and done,
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, f*ck love I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big but it beat quiet
how never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence

So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby I think it's better if I let you know

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)

No more tryin' to make it work
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her
You made me wanna say bye bye,
say bye bye, say bye bye to her

Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond

Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu

And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now

I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)

Blame it on that Conjure

Oh yeah, that's right, I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me
I'm living life right now, man, and this what I'mma do 'til it's over

Makin' sure the Young Money ship is never sinkin'
Bout to set it off in this bitch, Jada Pinkett
I shouldn't have drove, tell me how I'm getting home?
You too fine to be layin' down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language, Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing I've ever known
Got the gold thriller, Mike Jackson on these niggas

One thing about music, when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got the shit that makes these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me, I know better than that, it's just game
It's what comes with the fame and I'm ready for that, I'm just sayin'
But I really can't complain, everything is kosher
Two thumbs up
Ebert and Roper
I really can't see the end getting any closer
But I'll probably still be the man when everything is over
So I'm riding through this city with my high-beams on
Can you see me? Can you see me? Get your Visine on
Y'all just do not fit the picture, turn your wise friend on
If you thinkin' I'mma quit before I die, dream on
Man, they treat me like a legend, am I really this cold?
I'm really too young to be feeling this old
It's about time you admit it, who you kiddin'?
And nobody's ever done it like I did it

Can you get to my thoughts
Can you promise we won't let go
All the things that I need
All the things that you need
You can make it feel so real.
Cuz you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I touch your body
I feel I'm loosing control
Cuz you can't deny
You've blown my mind
When I see you baby
I just don't wanna let go
I hate to see you cry
Your smile is a beautiful lie
I hate to see you cry
My love's dying inside
I can fix all those lies
But baby, when I run, I'm running to you
You won't see me cry, I'm hiding inside

Pack Up,Eliza Doolittle, Pop,2010,81,67,-6,21,87,30,8,46,"I get tired and upset
And I'm trying to care a little less
When I Google I only get depressed
I was taught to dodge those issues I was told
Don't worry
Cos no doubt
There's always something to cry about
And when your stuck in an angry crowd
They don't think what they say before they open their mouth

You gotta

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea
I don't care what the people may say
What the people may say about me
Pack Up your troubles get your old grin back
Don't worry bout the cavalry
I don't care what the whisperers say
Cos they whisper too loud for me

Hot topic
Maybe I should drop it
It's a touchy subject
And I like to tiptoe round the ship going down
You got pennies but no pounds
So if your business is running out
It's not business to talk about
But they don't think what they say before they open their mouth

You gotta

Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag
And bury them beneath the sea

Love The Way You Lie,Eminem, Rap/Hip-Hop,2010,93,75,-5,52,64,24,23,87,"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her, the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me
And I love it, ""Wait
Where you going?"" ""I'm leaving you""
""No you ain't, come back""
We're running right back, here we go again
It's so insane 'cause when it's going good, it's going great
I'm Superman, with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snapped, ""Who's that dude?""
I don't even know his name, I laid hands on her
I'll never stoop so low again, I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at 'em
You swore you've never hit 'em, never do nothing to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya 'cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over, it's a different day
Sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns
Same routine, but your temper's just as bad as mine is
You're the same as me, when it comes to love, you're just as blinded
Baby, please come back, it wasn't you
Baby, it was me, maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'm a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's alright, because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's alright, because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie"
Not Afraid,Eminem, Rap/Hip-Hop,2010,95,86,-1,21,67,53,26,85,"I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
Yeah
To take a stand (to take a stand)
It's been a ride
Everybody (everybody)
I guess I had to go to that place
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
To get to this one
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Now some of you might still be in that place
Whatever weather, cold or warm
If you're tryna get out (just lettin' you know that you're not alone)
Just follow me (holla if you feel like you've been down the same road)
I'll get you there
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin' mayhem
When I say I'm a do somethin', I do it
I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world, feed it beans
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin' me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearin' down your balcony
No if, ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From ""Infinite"" down to the last ""Relapse"" album he's still shittin'
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly, until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt
And fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a wrap
You said you was king
You lied through your teeth, for that, fuck your feelings
Instead of gettin' crowned you're gettin' capped, and to the fans
I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise
In fact, let's be honest, that last ""Relapse"" CD was eh
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack, blaow, 'cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin' black cloud
Still follows me around but it's time to exercise these demons
These muh'fuckers are doin' jumpin' jacks now
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today
I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now (now)
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't realize what you did, ('cause) believe me you
I been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on
I promise to focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it, 'cause the way I feel
I'm strong enough to go to the club or the corner pub
And lift the whole liquor counter up 'cause I'm raising the bar
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin' at stars, I feel amazing and I'm not
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand come (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road"

I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,

Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses

And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite

Or was it, 'cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass buzzards, fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this ain't some bullshit
People don't usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let 'em bic's raise 'cause I came with five nine
But I feel like I'm six eight
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this I'll probably already be outtie
I advance like going from toting iron
To going and buying four or five of the homies the iron man Audi
My daddy told me slow down, boy, you goin' to blow it
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him the same way that he did Dr.Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I right
Till he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's Lebron's jersey in twenty years
I'll stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up
It's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up must come down
You going down on something you don't wanna see like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now
Life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cats meow, ow
Classic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
'Cause now I'm in the Aston
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic
Compared to a weed high
And y'all niggas just gossipin' like bitches on a radio and TV
See me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee-hive
And how real is that
I remember signing my first deal
And now I'm the second best I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight, but tonight we're alright
So hold up your light, let it shine 'cause
This one's for you and me, living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
With my arms out wide I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters"

You're laying waste to Halloween
You fucked it friend, it's on its head, it struck the street
You're in Milwaukee, off your feet
And at once, I knew I was not magnificent
Strayed above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
But I could see for miles, miles, miles
3rd and Lake, it burnt away, the hallway
Was where we learned to celebrate
Automatic bought the years you'd talk for me
That night you played me Lip Parade
Not the needle, nor the thread, the lost decree
Saying nothing, that's enough for me
And at once, I knew I was not magnificent
Hulled far from the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
But I could see for miles, miles, miles
Christmas night, it clutched the light, the hallow bright
Above my brother, I and tangled spines
We smoked the screen to make it what it was to be
Now to know it in my memory
And at once, I knew I was not magnificent
High above the highway aisle
Jagged vacance, thick with ice
But I could see for miles, miles, miles"

Champion (feat. Chris Brown),Chip, Rap/Hip-Hop,2011,93,42,-3,14,52,8,24,54,"Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give it up
They wanna hold you back, tell 'em pee off
Whenever they say you can't, take the T off
I remember when they told me I couldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality is simultaneous
And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal they can take you off
And there's a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don't do with what you got
Yeah, so get it in go sunny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky so you gotta feel
The hunger in your tummy
I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am, from the words you said
Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives

This gon be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the record, no camera's, forget a quote
Some of my family doing good, most doing dope
I from Virginia where they hang the n-ggas by rope
I used to see my momma getting beat down!
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can't even see down
Award shows, I poured my heart out
And people still steady trynna point my flaws out
And I'd be lying if I said it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history
I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am, from the words you said

Imagine you was the one, that couldn't get a look in
Couldn't get a booking
Couldn't get a push in when you needed a shove
Or your buttons they be pushing
So now they tryna shush him
It's only you believing in you
They turn you into a bastard than moment you rude
Attitude a little out of tune
But thats how champions move
Yeah so go and get it in sunny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money

She’s morphine queen of my vaccine my love my love love love, la la la la

Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
And ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah, ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah
Ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah, ahhh ahhh ahhh ah ah

She may contain the urge to runaway
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germaline disinfect the scene my love my love love love
But please don’t go I love you so my lovely
Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart, hey

Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so
Please don’t go, please don’t go, I love you so, I love you so
Please break my heart, ah ha

Please don’t go, I’ll eat you whole
I love you so, I love you, so I love you so
Please don’t go I’ll eat you whole

Tracy Island, time-travelin' diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet mornin' years too late
She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space
In my mind, when she's not right there beside me
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna ever say is, ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Oh, ah
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is I need the deep end
Keep imaginin' meetin', wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehavin' for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver linin', climbin' on my desire
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself
All I wanna ever say is, ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, ""You got me baby""
""Are you mine?""
She's a silver linin', lone ranger ridin' through an open space
In my mind, when she's not right there beside me

Kept doing all the things they do
They never really think it through
Like I can never think you're true

The guilt, the pain, the hurt, the shame

Money's the motivation
Money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid so
We on paid-cation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eye' closed
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
You use plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!
I never fear death or dyin'
I only fear never tryin'
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
Ayy, I'm not to be played with
Because it could get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
And the same ones that I ride with, be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with, if you're looking for me
You could find Wiz in the new car or the crowd
With my new broad, that's a fine chick
And no other squad I'm down with, ain't (no way around it)
What you say? Tell me what you say
Workin' hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this everyday
Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa
I never fear death or dyin'
I only fear never tryin'

Because it could get dangerous
See these people I ride with (I ride or die for life)
This moment, we own it
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life, and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feeling like a killer inside
Oh, financial outbreak, I'm free, but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plugs, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl (than her outfit)
Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam, and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who tryin' to say somethin'
One thing about it, got a problem? I got the same one
Money rose, we fold
Playin' in clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs
Our cars don't even lose control
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
Ayy, I'm not to be played with (I ride or die for mine)

And some aces up your sleeve

How many secrets can you keep'

When I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and
if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly
on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together, if you wanted to

And it's hard to love

Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Made me bounce around, like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone
Got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying? Girl why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, gotta strip it like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?

We spend it, with no shame
We blow that, like Coltrane
We in here, like Rogaine
Or leave it, like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like Lebron's mom

Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk
At least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping
I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hold up
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas, I'll be right by your side

Hol' up (hol' up), hol' up (hol' up)

I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na
Why can't I keep my fingers off you, baby?
I want you, na na

Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh baby, drunk in love we be all night
Last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club
Drunk in love

We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

We be all night, and everything alright
No complaints for my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, walking in my l'assemblage
I'm grubbing on the rope, grubbing if you scared, call that ribbon
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right
I'm on the Cognac, gangster wife
Newer sheets, he'd swear that I like washed rags, he wet up
Boy, I'm drinking, I'm sinking on the mic 'til my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then riding with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that big body Benz
Serving all this, swerv, surfing all of this good, good

Beautiful bodies grinding off in that club

We be all night, love, love

Hold up
That D'USSÉ is the shit if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house tryna backup all that mouth
That you had all in the car, talking 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talking 'bout you be reppin' that verb, wanna see all that shit I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood, hope you can handle this curve
Foreplay in the foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take draws off, on site
Catch a charge I might, beat the box up like Mike
In '97 I bite, I'm Ike, Turner, turn up
Baby no I don't play, now eat the cake, Annie Mae
Said, ""Eat the cake, Annie Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights we gon' need G3
4, 5, 6 flights, sleep tight
We sex again in the morning, your breasteses is my breakfast
We going in, we be all night

Love, love
We be all night, love, love

Never tired, never tired
I been sippin, that's the only thing keeping me on fire, me on fire
To me it's feeling like all of my entire life I've been drinking

You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair

To keep the cold night
From breaking in over the walls
Into the wild side
The hunger satisfies

We might as well be lovers on the sun
We might as well be lovers on the sun

We'll never know, we'll never know
What stands behind the North

It's a feeling that's we're dying for
Just close your eyes, and hold your breath
Because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

Ghost Town,Adam Lambert, Pop,2015,74,70,-6,17,27,19,5,69,"Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
There's no one left in the world
I'm gunslingin'
Don't give a fuck if I go
Down, down, down
I got a voice in my head that keeps singing
Oh, my heart is a ghost town
Ooh, my heart is a ghost town
Oh, my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering, I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here

An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more

Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking

Made memories we knew would never fade

He took me in his arms, I heard him say
""When you get older your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

For every tyrant, a tear for the vulnerable
In every lost soul, the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer, a dream, we're unstoppable

Tuesday, I was through with hoping
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love

Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around

How did I get so blind and so cynical?
If there's love in this life, we're unstoppable
No, we can't be defeated
Monday left me broken
Tuesday, I was through with hoping
Wednesday, my empty arms were open
Thursday, waiting for love, waiting for love
Thank the stars, it's Friday
I'm burning like a fire gone wild on Saturday
Guess I won't be coming to church on Sunday
I'll be waiting for love, waiting for love to come around"

When We Were Young,Adele, Pop/R&B,2016,60,38,-6,10,27,30,5,79,"Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk
To the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home
You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment?
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God this reminds me, of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were scared of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I'd swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me, of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young
(When we were young)
When we were young
(When we were young)
It's hard to win me back
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

It makes me reckless

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Here,Alessia Cara, Pop,2016,82,38,-4,8,33,8,10,71,"I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering, I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we can kick it and just listen
To some music with the message (like we usually do)
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with the girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwing up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking 'bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

When did you become so cruel?

Says a thousands words 'bout you

I got the rounds like Sugar Ray Robinson
Shot to the chest have you gasping for oxygen
I'ma spray 'em, just like Febreeze
Came a long way from sitting in the nosebleeds
Now a nigga on the floor talking to the athletes
Man I'm so close to the game I could steal the stat sheet
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive
Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side
Oh well, fuck 'em dog, we gon' see how hard they ride
I get racks to go outside, and I split it with the guys
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since like July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us, but I lied"

Got a bag and fixed my teeth
Hope you hoes know it ain't cheap

Man, I thought you would've learned your lesson
'Bout likin' pictures, not returnin' texts
I guess it's fine, man, I get the message
You still stutter after certain questions
You keep in contact with certain exes
Do you, though, trust me, nigga, it's cool, though
Said that you was workin', but you're out here chasin' culo
And putas, chillin' poolside, livin' two lives

Fuck him, suck his dick, you would've been pissed

I was here before all of this
Guess you actin' out now, you got an audience
Tell me where your mind is, drop a pin, what's the coordinates?
You might have a fortune, but you lose me, you still gon' be misfortunate, nigga
Tell me, this love's got you this fucked up in the head
You want some random bitch up in your bed?
She don't even know your middle name, watch her 'cause she might steal your chain
You don't want someone who loves you instead? I guess not though
It's blatant disrespect, you nothin' like the nigga I met
Talk to me crazy and you quick to forget
You even got me trippin', you got me lookin' in the mirror different
Thinkin' I'm flawed because you inconsistent
Between a rock and a hard place, the mud and the dirt
It's gon' hurt me to hate you, but lovin' you's worse
It all stops so abrupt, we start switchin' it up
Teach me to be like you so I can not give a fuck
Free to mess with someone else, I wish these feelings could melt
'Cause you don't care about a thing except your mothafuckin' self
You make me sick, nigga

I give you my everything, even my breath

I want to take photos of us and make them go viral
Your eyes make me focus like Adderall
With you, I pull up my overalls
I touch you and the world stops spinning
Not even death is going to separate us
Baby, I’m only yours
Tell him you’re coming with me
They should stop complimenting you
That no one’s gonna touch you

The guy that had all the Jordans and the Nikes
Tell these stupid guys to stop giving you likes
I want this whole night
To remember those times in the stairs
Tell him I’m not just some guy
I am your first, you are my first

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""

when I bought that Lamborghini (SethInTheKitchen)
Throw up my middle finger, police can't catch me, this a

Brand new Lamborghini, f*ck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? (Yeah)
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock (woo)
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me (woo)
You better let me go the day you need me (woo)
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' (woo)
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bussin'
Know you heard me say, ""You play, you lay,"" don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime 
just to check up on me and my brother, I'm really the baby
she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money (okay, let's go)
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot (boom)
Ptsd, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you (yeah, yeah), let's go

Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
You fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke (no smoke)
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote (let's go)

Heather,Conan Gray, Pop,2020,43,36,-7,32,27,58,1,86,"I still remember the third of December, me in your sweater
You said it looked better on me than it did you
Only if you knew how much I liked you
But I watch your eyes as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than the blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better
Wish I were Heather
Watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than the blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester

everything i wanted,Billie Eilish, Pop,2020,23,70,-14,11,24,90,1,0,"I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm being honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (might care, might care)
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
It could've been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me
And you say
""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?"

Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy?
Shut it, save it, keep it, pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
And knowing you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (yeah, yeah)

Mood (feat. iann dior),24kGoldn, Rap/Pop,2020,72,70,-4,32,73,17,1,89,"Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we're arguin' in my bedroom
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool

I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playing, not another day with you shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well you better save it for me
We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
